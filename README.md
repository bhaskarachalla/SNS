     nltk.download('stopwords')
     ```
   - **spaCy model**:
     ```bash
     python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the relevant notebooks:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Explore the notebooks**:
   - `NLPTokens.ipynb`: Focuses on text preprocessing and tokenization using NLTK and spaCy.
   - `PromptEngi.ipynb`: Demonstrates prompt engineering techniques and evaluation metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and GLUE.
   - `API.ipynb`: Shows how to integrate with an external API, fetch data based on user input, and process the fetched data.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. **Text Preprocessing and Tokenization (`NLPTokens.ipynb`)**

   - **Text Preprocessing**: Convert text to lowercase, remove punctuation, and filter out stop words.
   - **Tokenization**: Demonstrates different methods for tokenizing text using NLTK and spaCy.
   - **Edge Case Handling**: Covers how to deal with punctuation, different cases, and stop words.

### 2. **Prompt Engineering (`PromptEngi.ipynb`)**

   - **Prompt Techniques**: Craft prompts to guide language models towards specific responses.
   - **Model Integration**: Uses Hugging Face Transformers to work with NLP models.
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures the effectiveness of prompts using BLEU, ROUGE, and GLUE scores.

### 3. **API Integration (`API.ipynb`)**

   - **External API Integration**: Demonstrates how to connect to an external API and fetch data based on user input.
   - **Data Processing**: Shows how to handle and process the data retrieved from the API.
   - **Example Use Case**: A practical example of how to leverage external data in an NLP task.

## Features

- Comprehensive text preprocessing and tokenization methods.
- Detailed exploration of prompt engineering techniques.
- Integration with NLP models using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
- Fetching and processing data from external APIs to enhance NLP tasks.

## Metrics

- **BLEU Score**: Precision of model output compared to reference texts.
